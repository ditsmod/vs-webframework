The following command will allow you to view the status of running programs:

```bash
npx pm2 l
```

If you run this command immediately after running the benchmark, in particular you will see how much memory each of the applications is consuming.

Interesting information is in the `cpu` and `mem` columns. Also in `â†º` column you can see number of restarting the applications.

## Stop webservers
