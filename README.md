## Install and build

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ditsmod/vs-webframework.git
cd vs-webframework
npm i
npm run build
```

## Cold start

The shorter the cold-start time, the better the frameworks are suited for serverless technology. So, the results of a cold start are as follows:

| framework            | result, ms    |
|----------------------|:-------------:|
| koa v2.14            |  69           |
| ditsmod v2.41        |  84           |
| express v4.18        |  94           |
| fastify v4.21        |  164          |
| hapi v21.3           |  210          |
| restify v11.1        |  233          |
| nest v10.1 + express |  355          |
| nest v10.1 + fastify |  410          |

For now, these tests are run manually, for example:

```bash
node koa.js
# OR
node dist/ditsmod/main.js
# OR
node dist/nestjs/main-express.js
# ...
```

See `package.json` for more examples with start script.

## Run benchmarks

```bash
npm start
ab -n 50000 -c 10 localhost:3000/hello
```

Here you need manually changes port in the range from 3000 to 3007.

"Hello, World!" performance comparison for web frameworks:

- `Fastify`
- `Ditsmod`
- `Koa`
- `Restify`
- `Express`
- `Nestjs + Express`
- `Nestjs + Fastify`
- `Hapi`

The following command will allow you to view the status of running programs:

```bash
npx pm2 l
```

If you run this command immediately after running the benchmark, in particular you will see how much memory each of the applications is consuming.

Interesting information is in the `cpu` and `mem` columns. Also in `â†º` column you can see number of restarting the applications.

## Stop webservers

```bash
npm run stop
```
